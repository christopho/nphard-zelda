# NP-hard Zelda

NP-hard Zelda is a mini-game where you have to solve an NP-hard maze.
To play it, download the [Solarus engine](http://www.solarus-games.org/download)
and run Solarus with the data directory of NP-hard Zelda in the same folder.

This game is slightly boring, but computationally fascinating!
