Welcome to the NP-Zelda puzzle.



Some geeky mathematicians proved that
solving mazes in Zelda can be NP-hard.
This mini-game is an implementation of their
proof!
The maze you are going to traverse
is indeed equivalent to a well-known
NP-hard problem called 3-SAT.

To play, just take the hookshot
in the big chest and try to reach
the end of the room.

But beware: if you fall in a hole,
you have to restart everything!


This is slightly boring, but
computationally fascinating!
Good luck!
